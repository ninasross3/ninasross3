<h1>About Me</h1>

<h2>My name is Nina Ross. I'm a Sophmore at the University of Maine. I'm an outgoing, friendly girl with a big heart.
    I just recently changed my major from nursing, to business. Though I love to help those in need, I discovered I
    had a passion for organization and numbers and that is what I saw myself doing at the end of the day. I'm not sure
    yet what my end goal is. I am not only a full time student but also a full time employee at Acadia Hospital in
    Bangor. There, I spend my shifts working as a Pyschiatric Tech. Something I truly enjoy doing. I take pride in my
    grades and my schoowork, but I make sure to leave a decent amount of time for fun! I live for my two nephews, as
    I am very family oriented. I'm enjoying the business school and can't wait to see what it has in store for me.</h2>
